#Programming code - Programming code is a set of written computer instructions, guided by rules, using a computer programming language. It might help to think of the computer instructions as a detailed, step-by-step recipe for performing tasks. The instructions tell computers and machines how to perform an action. Programming code may also be referred to as source code or scripts.
'''
Programming languages - Programming languages are similar to human spoken languages in that they both use syntax and semantics. Programming languages are used to write computer programs.  Some common programming languages include Python, Java, C, C++, C#, and R.

Syntax - Syntax is a set of rules for how statements are constructed in both human and computer languages. Programming syntax includes rules for the order of elements in programming instructions, as well as the use of special characters and their placements in statements. This concept is similar to the syntax rules for grammar and punctuation in human language.

Semantics - Semantics refers to the intended meaning or effect of statements, or collections of words, in both human and computer languages. Semantic errors are also referred to as logical errors.

Computer program - A computer program is a step-by-step list of instructions that a computer follows to reach an intended goal. It is important to be clear and precise about the actions a computer program is supposed to perform because computers will do exactly what they are instructed to do. Computer programs can be long, complex, and accomplish a variety of tasks. They are often developed by computer programmers and software engineers, but anyone can learn to create them. Computer programs may involve a structured development cycle. They can be written in a wide variety of programming languages, such as Python, Java, C++,  R, and more. The completed format of a program is often a single executable file.

Script - Scripts are usually shorter and less complex than computer programs. Scripts are often used to automate specific tasks. However, they can be used for complex tasks if needed. Scripts are often written by IT professionals, but anyone can learn to write scripts. Scripts have a shorter, less structured development cycle as compared to the development of complex computer programs and software. Scripts can be written in a variety of programming languages, like Python, Javascript, Ruby, Bash, and more. Some scripting languages are interpreted languages and are only compatible with certain platforms.

Automation - Automation is used to replace a repetitive manual step with one that happens automatically. 

Output - Output is the end result of a task performed by a function or computer program. Output can include a single value, a report, entries into a database, and more. 

Input - Input is information that is provided to a program by the end user. Input can be text, voice, images, biometrics, and more.   

Functions - A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.

Variables - Variables are used to temporarily store changeable values in programming code. 

expression - a combination of numbers, symbols, or other values that produce a result when evaluated

data types - classes of data (e.g., string, int, float, Boolean, etc.), which include the properties and behaviors of instances of the data type (variables)

variable - an instance of a data type class, represented by a unique name within the code, that stores changeable values of the specific data type

implicit conversion - when the Python interpreter automatically converts one data type to another

explicit conversion - when code is written to manually convert one data type to another using a data type conversion function:

str() - converts a value (often numeric) to a string data type

int() - converts a value (usually a float) to an integer data type

float() - converts a value (usually an integer) to a float data type

We looked at a few examples of built-in functions in Python, but being able to define your own functions is incredibly powerful. We start a function definition with the def keyword, followed by the name we want to give our function. After the name, we have the parameters, also called arguments, for the function enclosed in parentheses. A function can have no parameters, or it can have multiple parameters. Parameters allow us to call a function and pass it data, with the data being available inside the function as variables with the same name as the parameters. Lastly, we put a colon at the end of the line.

After the colon, the function body starts. It’s important to note that in Python the function body is delimited by indentation. This means that all code indented to the right following a function definition is part of the function body. The first line that’s no longer indented is the boundary of the function body. It’s up to you how many spaces you use when indenting -- just make sure to be consistent. So if you choose to indent with four spaces, you need to use four spaces everywhere in your code.


In the Functions segment, you learned how to define and call functions, utilize a function’s parameters, and return data from a function. You also learned how to differentiate and convert between different data types utilizing variables. Plus, you learned a few best practices for writing reusable and readable code. 

Terms
return value - the value or variable returned as the end result of a function

parameter (argument) -  a value passed into a function for use within the function

refactoring code - a process to restructure code without changing functionality

Knowledge
The purpose of the def() keyword is to define a new function. 

Best practices for writing code that is readable and reusable:

Create a reusable function - Replace duplicate code with one reusable function to make the code easier to read and repurpose.

Refactor code - Update code so that it is self-documenting and the intent of the code is clear.

Add comments - Adding comments is part of creating self-documenting code. Using comments allows you to leave notes to yourself and/or other programmers to make the purpose of the code clear.

Comparison Operators with Equations
The following examples demonstrate how to use comparison operators with the data types int (integers, whole numbers) and float (number with a decimal point or fractional value). Comparison operators return Boolean results. As you learned previously, Boolean is a data type that can hold only one of two values: True or False.  

The comparison operators include: 

==    (equality) 

!=     (not equal to) 

>       (greater than)

<      (less than)

>=    (greater than or equal to)

<=    (less than or equal to)


PART 1: Equality == and Not Equal To != Operators
In Python, you can use comparison operators to compare values. When a comparison is made, Python returns a Boolean result: True or False. Note that Boolean data types are not string data types (Boolean True is not equal to the string "True").  

To check if two values are the same, use the equality operator: == 

To check if two values are not the same, use the not equal to operator: != 

We just covered the if statement, which executes code if an evaluation is true and skips the code if it’s false. But what if we wanted the code to do something different if the evaluation is false? We can do this using the else statement. The else statement follows an if block, and is composed of the keyword else followed by a colon. The body of the else statement is indented to the right, and will be executed if the above if statement doesn’t execute.

We also touched on the modulo operator, which is represented by the percent sign: %. This operator performs integer division, but only returns the remainder of this division operation. If we’re dividing 5 by 2, the quotient is 2, and the remainder is 1. Two 2s can go into 5, leaving 1 left over. So 5%2 would return 1. Dividing 10 by 5 would give us a quotient of 2 with no remainder, since 5 can go into 10 twice with nothing left over. In this case, 10%5 would return 0, as there is no remainder.

Building off of the if and else blocks, which allow us to branch our code depending on the evaluation of one statement, the elif statement allows us even more comparisons to perform more complex branching. Very similar to the if statements, an elif statement starts with the elif keyword, followed by a comparison to be evaluated. This is followed by a colon, and then the code block on the next line, indented to the right. An elif statement must follow an if statement, and will only be evaluated if the if statement was evaluated as false. You can include multiple elif statements to build complex branching in your code to do all kinds of powerful things!

Study Guide: Conditionals
This study guide provides a quick-reference summary of what you learned in this lesson and serves as a guide for the upcoming practice quiz.  

In the Conditionals segment, you learned about the built-in Python operators used for comparing values and the logical operators for making complex comparisons. You also learned how to use operators in if-else-elif blocks. 

 

Knowledge
Comparison operators with numerical values
Comparison expressions return a Boolean result (True or False). 

x == y        If x is equal to y, return True. Else, return False.

x != y         If x is not equal to y, return True. Else, return False.

x < y          If x is less than y, return True. Else, return False.

x <= y        If x is less than or equal to y, return True. Else, return False.

x > y          If x is greater than y, return True. Else, return False.

x >= y        If x is greater or equal to y, return True. Else, return False.

Comparison operators with strings
Comparison expressions with strings also return a Boolean result (True or False).

"x" == "y"  If the words are the same, return True. Else, return False.

"x" != "y"   If the words are not the same, return True. Else, return False.

When used with strings, the following comparison expressions will alphabetize the strings.

"x" < "y"   	If string "x"  has a smaller Unicode value than string "y", return True.  Else, return False.

"x" <= "y" 	If the Unicode value for string "x" is smaller than or equal to the Unicode value of string "y", return True. Else, return False.

"x" > "y"    	If string "x" has a larger Unicode value than string "y", return True. Else, return False.

"x" >= "y"  	If the Unicode value for string "x" is greater than or equal to the Unicode value of string "y", return True. Else, return False.

Logical operators
Logical operators are used to combine comparison expressions and also return Boolean results (True or False).

comparison1 and comparison2 

Returns a True result if both comparison1 and comparison2 are true. 

If they are not both true, return False.

comparison1 or comparison2 

Returns a True result if either comparison1 and/or comparison2 are True. 

If neither comparison is true, return False.

not comparison1

Returns the inverse Boolean value of the comparison. 

Returns a True result if comparison1 is false. 

If comparison1 is true, then returns False.

What “self-documenting code” means


There may be a few questions on the quiz that will ask you about either the output of a small block of code or the value of part of the code. Make sure to read the instructions carefully on those questions.

Anatomy of a While Loop
A while loop will continuously execute code depending on the value of a condition. It begins with the keyword while, followed by a comparison to be evaluated, then a colon. On the next line is the code block to be executed, indented to the right. Similar to an if statement, the code in the body will only be executed if the comparison is evaluated to be true. What sets a while loop apart, however, is that this code block will keep executing as long as the evaluation statement is true. Once the statement is no longer true, the loop exits and the next line of code will be executed.  

Common Pitfalls With Variable Initialization
You'll want to watch out for a common mistake: forgetting to initialize variables. If you try to use a variable without first initializing it, you'll run into a NameError. This is the Python interpreter catching the mistake and telling you that you’re using an undefined variable. The fix is pretty simple: initialize the variable by assigning the variable a value before you use it.

Another common mistake to watch out for that can be a little trickier to spot is forgetting to initialize variables with the correct value. If you use a variable earlier in your code and then reuse it later in a loop without first setting the value to something you want, your code may wind up doing something you didn't expect. Don't forget to initialize your variables before using them!

Infinite loops and Code Blocks
Another easy mistake that can happen when using loops is introducing an infinite loop. An infinite loop means the code block in the loop will continue to execute and never stop. This can happen when the condition being evaluated in a while loop doesn't change. Pay close attention to your variables and what possible values they can take. Think about unexpected values, like zero.

In the Coursera code blocks, you may see an error message that reads "Evaluation took more than 5 seconds to complete." This means that the code encountered an infinite loop, and it timed out after 5 seconds. You should take a closer look at the code and variables to spot where the infinite loop is.

while Loops
A while loop executes the body of the loop while a specified condition remains True. They are commonly used when there’s an unknown number of operations to be performed, and a condition needs to be checked at each iteration.

Common Errors in while Loops
If you get an error message on a loop or it appears to hang, your debugging checklist should include the following checks:

Failure to initialize variables. Make sure all the variables used in the loop’s condition are initialized before the loop.

Unintended infinite loops. Make sure that the body of the loop modifies the variables used in the condition, so that the loop will eventually end for all possible values of the variables. You can often prevent an infinite loop by using the break keyword or by adding end criteria to the condition part of the while loop.

 

while Loop Terms
while loop - Tells the computer to execute a set of instructions while a specified condition is True. In other words, while loops keep executing the same group of instructions until the condition becomes False.

infinite loop - Missing a method for exiting the loop, causing the loop to run forever.

break - A keyword that can be used to end a loop at a specific point. 

 

Math Concepts on the Practice Quiz
The coding problems on the upcoming practice quiz will involve a few math concepts. Don’t worry if you are rusty on math. You will have plenty of support with these concepts on the quiz. The following is a quick overview of the math terms you will encounter on the quiz:  

prime numbers - Integers that have only two factors, which are the number itself multiplied by 1. The lowest prime number is 2.

prime factors - Prime numbers that are factors of an integer. For example, the prime numbers 2 and 5 are the prime factors of the number 10 (2x5=10). The prime factors of an integer will not produce a remainder when used to divide that integer. 

divisor - A number (denominator) that is used to divide another number (numerator). For example, if the number 10 is divided by 5, the number 5 is the divisor.

sum of all divisors of a number - The result of adding all of the divisors of a number together.  

multiplication table - An integer multiplied by a series of numbers and their results formatted as a table or a list. For example:

                 4x1=4
                 4x2=8
                 4x3=12
                 4x4=16
                 4x5=20

                 For loops allow you to iterate over a sequence of values. Let's take the example from the beginning of the video:


FOR LOOPS                 
for x in range(5):

  print(x)

Similar to if statements and while loops, for loops begin with the keyword for with a colon at the end of the line. Just like in function definitions, while loops and if statements, the body of the for loop begins on the next line and is indented to the right. But what about the stuff in between the for keyword and the colon? In our example, we’re using the range() function to create a sequence of numbers that our for loop can iterate over. In this case, our variable x points to the current element in the sequence as the for loop iterates over the sequence of numbers. Keep in mind that in Python and many programming languages, a range of numbers will start at 0, and the list of numbers generated will be one less than the provided value. So range(5) will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to 4, for a total of 5 numbers.

Bringing this all together, the range(5) function will create a sequence of numbers from 0 to 4. Our for loop will iterate over this sequence of numbers, one at a time, making the numbers accessible via the variable x and the code within our loop body will execute for each iteration through the sequence. So for the first loop, x will contain 0, the next loop, 1, and so on until it reaches 4. Once the end of the sequence comes up, the loop will exit and the code will continue.

The power of for loops comes from the fact that it can iterate over a sequence of any kind of data, not just a range of numbers. You can use for loops to iterate over a list of strings, such as usernames or lines in a file.

Not sure whether to use a for loop or a while loop? Remember that a while loop is great for performing an action over and over until a condition has changed. A for loop works well when you want to iterate over a sequence of elements.  

A Closer Look at the Range() Function
The in keyword, when used with the range() function, generates a sequence of integer numbers, which can be used with a for loop to control the start point, the end point, and the incremental values of the loop.  

Syntax:

123
for n in range(x, y, z):
    print(n)

The range() function uses a set of indices that point to integer values, which start at the number 0. The numeric values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 correlate to ordinal index positions 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th. So, when a range call to the 5th index position is made using range(5) the index is pointing to the numeric value of 4.

Index Number

1st index

2nd index

3rd index

4th index

5th index

Value

0

1

2

3

4

The range() function can take up to three parameters:  range(start, stop, step) 

Start 
The first item in the range() function parameters is the starting position of the range. The default is the first index position, which points to the numeric value 0. This value is included in the range. 

Stop
The second item in the range() function parameters is the ending position of the range. There is no default index position, so this index number must be given to the range() parameters. For example, the line for n in range(4) will loop 4 times with the n variable starting at 0 and looping 4 index positions: 0, 1, 2, 3. As you can see, range(4) (meaning index position 4) ends at the numeric value 3. In Python, this structure may be phrased as “the end-of-range value is excluded from the range.” In order to include the value 4 in  range(4), the syntax can be written as range(4+1) or range(5). Both of these ranges will produce the numeric values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. 

Step
The third item in the range() function parameters is the incremental step value. The default increment is +1. The default value can be overridden with any valid increment. However, note that the loop will still end at the end-of-range index position, regardless of the incremental value. For example, if you have a loop with the range: for n in range(1, 5, 6), the range will only produce the numeric value 1. This is because the incremental value of 6 exceeded the ending point of the range.

Key takeaways
The roles of the range(start, stop, step) function parameters are:

Start - Beginning of range

value included in range

default = 0

Stop - End of range

value excluded from range (to include, use stop+1)

no default

must provide the ending index number 

Step - Incremental value 

default = 1

Study Guide: for Loops
This study guide provides a summary of what you learned in this segment and serves as a guide for the upcoming practice quiz.  

In the for Loops segment, you learned about the logical structure and syntax of for loops. You took a closer look at the range() function. You learned about nested for loops and complex nested for loops with if statements. You also learned how to fix common errors in for loops.


for Loops vs. while Loops
for loops and while loops share several characteristics. Both loops can be used with a variety of data types, both can be nested, and both can be used with the keywords break and continue. However, there are important differences between the two types of loops: 

while loops are used when a segment of code needs to execute repeatedly while a condition is true

for loops iterate over a sequence of elements, executing the body of the loop for each element in the sequence

Common for Loop Structures 
for Loop with range()
The in keyword with the range() function generates a sequence of integer numbers, which can be used with a for loop to configure the iterations of the code. The range of numbers [0, 1, 2] correlates to ordinal index positions (1st, 2nd, 3rd), rather than the cardinal (quantity) values of the numbers 0, 1, and 2. For example, range(5) means the five index positions in the range [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. 

The range() function can take up to three parameters. The roles of the three possible range(x,y,z) parameters are:

x = Start - Starting index position of the range 

Default index position is 0.

The starting index position is included in the range. 

Example syntax: range(2, y, z) or range(x+3, y, z) 

y = Stop - Ending index position of range

No default index position. Must include the ending index position in the range() parameters.

Example syntax: range(y)

The value of the ending index position is excluded from the range. 

To include the ending index number, use the expression: y+1 (index + 1)

Example syntax: range(x, y+1, z)

Alternatively, if y = 10, you can write: range(x, 11, z)

z = Step - Incremental value

Default increment is +1.

The default value can be overridden with any valid increment.

The incremental value will end the for loop before it reaches the end of range index position (end of range index minus 1).  

Reminder: Correct syntax is critical
Using precise syntax is critical when writing code in any programming language, including Python. Even a small typo can cause a syntax error and the automated Python-coded quiz grader will mark your code as incorrect. This reflects real life coding errors in the sense that a single error in spelling, case, punctuation, etc. can cause your code to fail. Coding problems caused by imprecise syntax will always be an issue whether you are learning a programming language or you are using programming skills on the job. So, it is critical to start the habit of being precise in your code now. 

No credit will be given if there are any coding errors on the automated graded quizzes - including minor errors. Fortunately, you have 3 optional retake opportunities on the graded quizzes in this course. Additionally, you have unlimited retakes on practice quizzes and can review the videos and readings as many times as you need to master the concepts in this course.  

Now, before starting the graded quiz, please review this list of common syntax errors coders make when writing code.

Common syntax errors:
Misspellings

Incorrect indentations

Missing or incorrect key characters:

Parenthetical types - ( curved ), [ square ], { curly }

Quote types - "straight-double" or 'straight-single', “curly-double” or ‘curly-single’

Block introduction characters, like colons - :

Data type mismatches

Missing, incorrectly used, or misplaced Python reserved words

Using the wrong case (uppercase/lowercase) - Python is a case-sensitive language 

String Indexing and Slicing
String indexing allows you to access individual characters in a string. You can do this by using square brackets and the location, or index, of the character you want to access. It's important to remember that Python starts indexes at 0. So to access the first character in a string, you would use the index [0]. If you try to access an index that’s larger than the length of your string, you’ll get an IndexError. This is because you’re trying to access something that doesn't exist! You can also access indexes from the end of the string going towards the start of the string by using negative values. The index [-1] would access the last character of the string, and the index [-2] would access the second-to-last character.

You can also access a portion of a string, called a slice or a substring. This allows you to access multiple characters of a string. You can do this by creating a range, using a colon as a separator between the start and end of the range, like [2:5]. 

This range is similar to the range() function we saw previously. It includes the first number, but goes to one less than the last number. For example:

>>> fruit = "Mangosteen"
>>> fruit[1:4]
'ang'

The slice includes the character at index 1, and excludes the character at index 4. You can also easily reference a substring at the start or end of the string by only specifying one end of the range. For example, only giving the end of the range:

>>> fruit[:5]
'Mango'

This gave us the characters from the start of the string through index 4, excluding index 5. On the other hand this example gives is the characters including index 5, through the end of the string:

>>> fruit[5:]
'steen'

You might have noticed that if you put both of those results together, you get the original string back!

>>> fruit[:5] + fruit[5:]
'Mangosteen'

Cool!

Basic String Methods
In Python, strings are immutable. This means that they can't be modified. So if we wanted to fix a typo in a string, we can't simply modify the wrong character. We would have to create a new string with the typo corrected. We can also assign a new value to the variable holding our string.

If we aren't sure what the index of our typo is, we can use the string method index to locate it and return the index. Let's imagine we have the string "lions tigers and bears" in the variable animals. We can locate the index that contains the letter g using animals.index("g"), which will return the index; in this case 8. We can also use substrings to locate the index where the substring begins. animals.index("bears") would return 17, since that’s the start of the substring. If there’s more than one match for a substring, the index method will return the first match. If we try to locate a substring that doesn't exist in the string, we’ll receive a ValueError explaining that the substring was not found.

animals = "lions tigers and bears"
animals.index("g")

animals = "lions tigers and bears"
animals.index("bears")

We can avoid a ValueError by first checking if the substring exists in the string. This can be done using the in keyword. We saw this keyword earlier when we covered for loops. In this case, it's a conditional that will be either True or False. If the substring is found in the string, it will be True. If the substring is not found in the string, it will be False. Using our previous variable animals, we can do "horses" in animals to check if the substring "horses" is found in our variable. In this case, it would evaluate to False, since horses aren’t included in our example string. If we did "tigers" in animals, we'd get True, since this substring is contained in our string.

animals = "lions tigers and bears"
"horses" in animals

animals = "lions tigers and bears"
"tigers" in animals

Advanced String Methods
We've covered a bunch of String class methods already, so let's keep building on those and run down some more advanced methods.

The string method lower will return the string with all characters changed to lowercase. The inverse of this is the upper method, which will return the string all in uppercase. Just like with previous methods, we call these on a string using dot notation, like "this is a string".upper(). This would return the string "THIS IS A STRING". This can be super handy when checking user input, since someone might type in all lowercase, all uppercase, or even a mixture of cases.

You can use the strip method to remove surrounding whitespace from a string. Whitespace includes spaces, tabs, and newline characters. You can also use the methods  lstrip and rstrip to remove whitespace only from the left or the right side of the string, respectively.

The method count can be used to return the number of times a substring appears in a string. This can be handy for finding out how many characters appear in a string, or counting the number of times a certain word appears in a sentence or paragraph.

If you wanted to check if a string ends with a given substring, you can use the method endswith. This will return True if the substring is found at the end of the string, and False if not.

The isnumeric method can check if a string is composed of only numbers. If the string contains only numbers, this method will return True. We can use this to check if a string contains numbers before passing the string to the int() function to convert it to an integer, avoiding an error. Useful!

We took a look at string concatenation using the plus sign, earlier. We can also use the join method to concatenate strings. This method is called on a string that will be used to join a list of strings. The method takes a list of strings to be joined as a parameter, and returns a new string composed of each of the strings from our list joined using the initial string. For example, " ".join(["This","is","a","sentence"]) would return the string "This is a sentence".

The inverse of the join method is the split method. This allows us to split a string into a list of strings. By default, it splits by any whitespace characters. You can also split by any other characters by passing a parameter.

String Formatting
You can use the format method on strings to concatenate and format strings in all kinds of powerful ways. To do this, create a string containing curly brackets, {}, as a placeholder, to be replaced. Then call the format method on the string using .format() and pass variables as parameters. The variables passed to the method will then be used to replace the curly bracket placeholders. This method automatically handles any conversion between data types for us. 

If the curly brackets are empty, they’ll be populated with the variables passed in the order in which they're passed. However, you can put certain expressions inside the curly brackets to do even more powerful string formatting operations. You can put the name of a variable into the curly brackets, then use the names in the parameters. This allows for more easily readable code, and for more flexibility with the order of variables.

You can also put a formatting expression inside the curly brackets, which lets you alter the way the string is formatted. For example, the formatting expression {:.2f} means that you’d format this as a float number, with two digits after the decimal dot. The colon acts as a separator from the field name, if you had specified one. You can also specify text alignment using the greater than operator: >. For example, the expression {:>3.2f} would align the text three spaces to the right, as well as specify a float number with two decimal places. String formatting can be very handy for outputting easy-to-read textual output.

String Reference Guide
In Python, there are a lot of things you can do with strings. In this guide, you’ll find the most common string operations and string methods.

String operations
len(string) - Returns the length of the string

for character in string - Iterates over each character in the string

if substring in string - Checks whether the substring is part of the string

string[i] - Accesses the character at index i of the string, starting at zero

string[i:j] - Accesses the substring starting at index i, ending at index j minus 1. If i is omitted, its value defaults to 0. If j is omitted, the value will default to len(string).

Formatting Strings Guide
Python offers different ways to format strings. In the video, we explained the format() method. In this reading, we'll highlight three different ways of formatting strings. For this course you only need to know the format() method. But on the internet, you might find any of the three, so it's a good idea to know that the others exist.

Using the format() method
The format method returns a copy of the string where the {} placeholders have been replaced with the values of the variables. These variables are converted to strings if they weren't strings already. Empty placeholders are replaced by the variables passed to format in the same order.

# "base string with {} placeholders".format(variables)

example = "format() method"

formatted_string = "this is an example of using the {} on a string".format(example)

print(formatted_string)

"""Outputs:
this is an example of using the format() method on a string

If the placeholders indicate a number, they’re replaced by the variable corresponding to that order (starting at zero)

# "{0} {1}".format(first, second)

first = "apple"
second = "banana"
third = "carrot"

formatted_string = "{0} {2} {1}".format(first, second, third)

print(formatted_string)

"""Outputs:
apple carrot banana

If the placeholders indicate a field name, they’re replaced by the variable corresponding to that field name. This means that parameters to format need to be passed indicating the field name.

# "{var1} {var2}".format(var1=value1, var2=value2)

"{:exp1} {:exp2}".format(value1, value2)

If the placeholders include a colon, what comes after the colon is a formatting expression. See below for the expression reference.

# {:d} integer value
'{:d}'.format(10.5) → '10'

Formatting expressions
Expr

Meaning

Example

{:d}

integer value

'{:d}'.format(10.5) → '10'

{:.2f}

floating point with that many decimals

'{:.2f}'.format(0.5) → '0.50'

{:.2s}

string with that many characters

'{:.2s}'.format('Python') → 'Py'

{:<6s}

string aligned to the left that many spaces

'{:<6s}'.format('Py') → 'Py    '

{:>6s}

string aligned to the right that many spaces

'{:>6s}'.format('Py') → '    Py'

{:^6s}

string centered in that many spaces

'{:^6s}'.format('Py') → '  Py  

Old string formatting (Optional)
The format() method was introduced in Python 2.6. Before that, the % (modulo) operator could be used to get a similar result. While this method is no longer recommended for new code, you might come across it in someone else's code. This is what it looks like:

 "base string with %s placeholder" % variable

The % (modulo) operator returns a copy of the string where the placeholders indicated by %  followed by a formatting expression are replaced by the variables after the operator.


 "base string with %d and %d placeholders" % (value1, value2)

To replace more than one value, the values need to be written between parentheses. The formatting expression needs to match the value type.

 

"%(var1) %(var2)" % {var1:value1, var2:value2}

Variables can be replaced by name using a dictionary syntax (we’ll learn about dictionaries in an upcoming video).

 

"Item: %s - Amount: %d - Price: %.2f" % (item, amount, price)

The formatting expressions are mostly the same as those of the format() method. 

Formatted string literals (Optional)
This feature was added in Python 3.6 and isn’t used a lot yet. Again, it's included here in case you run into it in the future, but it's not needed for this or any upcoming courses.

A formatted string literal or f-string is a string that starts with 'f' or 'F' before the quotes. These strings might contain {} placeholders using expressions like the ones used for format method strings.

The important difference with the format method is that it takes the value of the variables from the current context, instead of taking the values from parameters.

 Examples:

>>> name = "Micah"

>>> print(f'Hello {name}')

Hello Micah

 

>>> item = "Purple Cup"

>>> amount = 5

>>> price = amount * 3.25

>>> print(f'Item: {item} - Amount: {amount} - Price: {price:.2f}')

Item: Purple Cup - Amount: 5 - Price: 16.25

Study Guide: Strings
This study guide provides a quick-reference summary of what you learned in this lesson and serves as a guide for the upcoming practice quiz. The string readings in this section are great syntax guides to help you on the Strings Practice Quiz.

In the Strings segment, you learned about the parts of a string, string indexing and slicing, creating new strings, string methods and operations, and formatting strings. 


Knowledge
String Operations and Methods
.format() - String method that can be used to concatenate and format strings. 

{:.2f} - Within the .format() method, limits a floating point variable to 2 decimal places. The number of decimal places can be customized.

len(string) - String operation that returns the length of the string.

string[x] - String operation that accesses the character at index [x] of the string, where indexing starts at zero.

string[x:y] - String operation that accesses a substring starting at index [x] and ending at index [y-1]. If x is omitted, its value defaults to 0. If y is omitted, the value will default to len(string).

string.replace(old, new) - String method that returns a new string where all occurrences of an old substring have been replaced by a new substring.

string.lower() - String method that returns a copy of the string with all lowercase characters.

    

Coding skills
Skill Group 1
Use a for loop to iterate through each letter of a string.

Add a character to the front of a string.

Add a character to the end of a string.

Use the .lower() string method to convert the case (uppercase/lowercase) of the letters within a string variable. This method is often used to eliminate cases as a factor when comparing two strings. For example, all lowercase “cat” is not equal to “Cat” because “Cat” contains an uppercase letter. To be able to compare the two strings to see if they are the same word, you can use the .lower() string method to remove capitalization as a factor in the string comparison.

# This function accepts a given string and checks each character of 
# the string to see if it is a letter or not. If the character is a
# letter, that letter is added to the end of the string variable
# "forwards" and to the beginning of the string variable "backwards".
def mirrored_string(my_string):

    # Two variables are initialized as string data types using empty 
    # quotes. The variable "forwards" will hold the "my_string"
    # minus any character that is not a letter. The "backwards" 
    # variable will hold the same letters as "forwards", but in  
    # in reverse order.
    forwards = ""
    backwards = ""

    # The for loop iterates through each character of the "my_string"
    for character in my_string:

        # The if-statement checks if the character is not a space.
        if character.isalpha():

            # If True, the body of the loop adds the character to the
            # to the end of "forwards" and to the front of
            # "backwards". 
            forwards += character
            backwards = character + backwards

        # If False (meaning the character is not a letter), no action
        # is needed. This coding approach results prevents any 
        # non-alphabetical characters from being written to the
        # "forwards" and "backwards" variables. The for loop will 
        # restart until all characters in "my_string" have been
        # processed.
        
    # The final if-statement compares the "forwards" and "backwards"
    # strings to see if the letters are the same both forwards and
    # backwards. Since Python is case sensitive, the two strings will 
    # need to be converted to use the same case for this comparison. 
    if forwards.lower() == backwards.lower():
        return True
    return False
 
print(mirrored_string("12 Noon")) # Should be True
print(mirrored_string("Was it a car or cat I saw")) # Should be False
print(mirrored_string("'eve, Madam Eve")) # Should be True

Skill Group 2
Use the format() method, with {} placeholders for variable data, to create a new string.

Use a formatting expression, like {:.2f}, to format a float variable and configure the number of decimal places to display for the float. 

# This function converts measurement equivalents. Output is formatted 
# as, "x ounces equals y pounds", with y limited to 2 decimal places. 
def convert_weight(ounces):

    # Conversion formula: 1 pound = 16 ounces
    pounds = ounces/16 
    
    # The result is composed using the .format() method. There are two
    # placeholders in the string: the first is for the "ounces" 
    # variable and the second is for the "pounds" variable. The second
    # placeholder formats the float result of the conversion 
    # calculation to be limited to 2 decimal places.
    result = "{} ounces equals {:.2f} pounds".format(ounces,pounds)
    return result


print(convert_weight(12)) # Should be: 12 ounces equals 0.75 pounds
print(convert_weight(50.5)) # Should be: 50.5 ounces equals 3.16 pounds
print(convert_weight(16)) # Should be: 16 ounces equals 1.00 pounds

Skill Group 3  

Within the format() parameters, select characters at specific index [ ] positions from a variable string.  

Use the format() method, with {} placeholders for variable data, to create a new string.

# This function generates a username using the first 3 letters of a
# user’s last name plus their birth year. 
def username(last_name, birth_year):
    
    # The .format() method will use the first 3 letters at index 
    # positions [0,1,2] of the "last_name" variable for the first
    # {} placeholder. The second {} placeholder concatenates the user’s
    #  "birth_year" to that string to form a new string username.
    return("{}{}".format(last_name[0:3],birth_year))


print(username("Ivanov", "1985")) 
# Should display "Iva1985" 
print(username("Rodríguez", "2000")) 
# Should display "Rod2000" 
print(username("Deng", "1991")) 
# Should display "Den1991"

 Skill Group 4  

Use the .replace() method to replace part of a string.  

Use the len() function to get the number of index positions in a string.

Slice a string at a specific index position.

# This function checks a given schedule entry for an old date and, if 
# found, the function replaces it with a new date. 
def replace_date(schedule, old_date, new_date):

    # Check if the given "old_date" appears at the end of the given 
    # string variable "schedule". 
    if schedule.endswith(old_date):

        # If True, the body of the if-block will run. The variable "n" is
        # used to hold the slicing index position. The len() function
        # is used to measure the length of the string "new_date".
        p = len(old_date)

        # The "new_schedule" string holds the updated string with the 
        # old date replaced by the new date. The schedule[:-p] part of 
        # the code trims the "old_date" substring from "schedule" 
        # starting at the final index position (or right-side) counting
        # towards the left the same number of index positions as 
        # calculated from len(old_date). Then, the code schedule[-p:]
        # starts the indexing position at the slot where the first
        # character of the "old_date" used to be positioned. The 
        # .replace(old_date, new_date) code inserts the "new_date" into
        # the position where the "old_date" used to exist.  
        new_schedule = schedule[:-p] + schedule[-p:].replace(old_date, new_date)

        # Returns the schedule with the new date.
        return new_schedule
        
    # If the schedule does not end with the old date, then return the
    # original sentence without any modifications.
    return schedule
 
 
print(replace_date("Last year’s annual report will be released in March 2023", "2023", "2024")) 
# Should display "Last year’s annual report will be released in March 2024"
print(replace_date("In April, the CEO will hold a conference", "April", "May")) 
# Should display "In April, the CEO will hold a conference"
print(replace_date("The convention is scheduled for October", "October", "June")) 
# Should display "The convention is scheduled for June"
