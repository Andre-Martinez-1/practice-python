# This while loop prints the multiples of 5 between 1 and 50. The
# "multiplier" variable is initialized with the starting value of 1. 
# The "result" variable is initialized with the value of the 
# "multiplier" variable times 5. 
 
# The while loop specifies that the loop must iterate while it is True 
# that the "result" is less than or equal to 50. Within the while loop, 
# the code tells the Python interpreter to print the value of the 
# "result" variable. Then, the "multiplier" is incremented by 1 and the
# "result" is assigned the new value of the "multiplier" times 5. 
 
# The end of the while loop is indicated by the indentation of the next 
# line of code moving one tab to the left. At this point, the Python
# interpreter automatically loops back to the beginning of the while
# loop to check the condition again with the new value of the "result"
# variable. When the while loop condition becomes False (meaning
# "result" is no longer less than or equal to 50), the interpreter exits
# the loop and reads the next line of code outside of the loop. In this 
# case, that next line tells the interpreter to print the string "Done".

'''Additional Recursion Sources
Additional Recursion Sources
In the past videos, we visited the basic concepts of recursive functions.

A recursive function must include a recursive case and base case. The recursive case calls the function again, with a different value. The base case returns a value without calling the same function.

A recursive function will usually have this structure:'''
